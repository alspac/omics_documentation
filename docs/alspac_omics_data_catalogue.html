<p>
Over the course of the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/">ALSPAC</a> study many large scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics">omics</a> datasets have been developed. This document acts as an overview and guide to help researchers determine the appropriate dataset(s) to <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/">request</a> for their studies.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Note that several rounds of genomic data collection have occurred and continue to occur due to emergence of new improved technologies, meaning that there are numerous versions of the genomic data available to researchers. There are three main types of genomic data available to researchers at the present time: genotype array data, genotype array data imputed to sequence level density, and genotype sequenced data. Imputation has been performed several times as new sequenced reference panels become available. The same types of data have not yet been generated for all participants though plans are underway to unify the imputation batches across all array genotyped individuals.

DNA methylation datasets and gene expression datasets, both based on arrays, are described in this document. Metabolomic data is separately described in the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/">ALSPAC data catalog</a>.

<p>
Every omic dataset that can be requested by researchers has an entry in this document. The entry is comprised of several sections that are each written in <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> format in order to organise meta data fields in a human readable way. The available data is summarised in the following
table. For full details of the data set please see the appropriate section of this document.

Title: ALSPAC imputed to Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (30/09/2015)

Description: |
  SNP chips are useful for the generation of data on hundreds of thousands of SNPs, but there are millions more polymorphisms that remain untyped with this technology. If suitable numbers of whole genome sequences exist (e.g. 1000 genomes data) then millions of genotypes that are missing from a sample because they have not been typed by SNP chips can be imputed using probabilistic methods. Here the ALSPAC mother and children data were imputed to a new reference panel known as the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel. This comprises around 31000 sequenced individuals (mostly European), so the coverage of European haplotypes is much greater than in other panels. As a consequence imputation accuracy is expected to improve, particularly at lower frequencies.

  The ALSPAC genotype data generated using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad (children) and Illumina human660W quad (mothers) has been jointly phased using ShapeIt v2 (which uses relationship information to improve phasing accuracy) and imputed to the HRC panel (pre-release 2015).

  ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad chip genotyping platforms by 23andme subcontracting the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK and the Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, US. The resulting raw genome-wide data were subjected to standard quality control methods. Individuals were excluded on the basis of gender mismatches; minimal or excessive heterozygosity; disproportionate levels of individual missingness (&gt;3%) and insufficient sample replication (IBD &lt; 0.8). Population stratification was assessed by multidimensional scaling analysis and compared with Hapmap II (release 22) European descent (CEU), Han Chinese, Japanese and Yoruba reference populations; all individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. SNPs with a minor allele frequency of &lt; 1%, a call rate of &lt; 95% or evidence for violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 5E-7) were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as proportion of identity by descent (IBD &gt; 0.1). Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,115 subjects and 500,527 SNPs passed these quality control filters.

  ALSPAC mothers were genotyped using the Illumina human660W-quad array at Centre National de Génotypage (CNG) and genotypes were called with Illumina GenomeStudio. PLINK (v1.07) was used to carry out quality control measures on an initial set of 10,015 subjects and 557,124 directly genotyped SNPs. SNPs were removed if they displayed more than 5% missingness or a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P value of less than 1.0e-06. Additionally SNPs with a minor allele frequency of less than 1% were removed. Samples were excluded if they displayed more than 5% missingness, had indeterminate X chromosome heterozygosity or extreme autosomal heterozygosity. Samples showing evidence of population stratification were identified by multidimensional scaling of genome-wide identity by state pairwise distances using the four HapMap populations as a reference, and then excluded. Cryptic relatedness was assessed using a IBD estimate of more than 0.125 which is expected to correspond to roughly 12.5% alleles shared IBD or a relatedness at the first cousin level. Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,048 subjects and 526,688 SNPs passed these quality control filters.

  We combined 477,482 SNP genotypes in common between the sample of mothers and sample of children. We removed SNPs with genotype missingness above 1% due to poor quality (11,396 SNPs removed) and removed a further 321 subjects due to potential ID mismatches. This resulted in a dataset of 17,842 subjects containing 6,305 duos and 465,740 SNPs (112 were removed during liftover and 234 were out of HWE after combination). We estimated haplotypes using ShapeIT (v2.r644) which utilises relatedness during phasing. The phased haplotypes were then imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel of approximately 31,000 phased whole genomes. The HRC panel was phased using ShapeIt v2, and the imputation was performed using Impute V3.

  This gave 8,237 eligible children and 8,196 eligible mothers with available genotype data after exclusion of related subjects using cryptic relatedness measures described previously.

  'Whole Genome Sequencing': |

  ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts were sequenced to an average read depth of 6.7x through the UK10K program (www.uk10k.org). Whole genome sequencing was completed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Beijing Genomics Institute. Briefly, DNA was sheared and subjected to Illumina paired-end DNA library preparation and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Reads were aligned to the GRCh37 human reference, using BWA (v0.5.9-r16). BAM files were further processed to realign around known INDELs, base quality score recalibration, addition of BAQ tags using GATK.
SNV calls were completed using samtools/bcftools (version 0.1.18-r579), and were then called to produce a VCF file. The pipeline to create these calls is available from: https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr- codebase/tree/develop.
Sites were called using the Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) and GATK Unified Genotyper was used to recall the sites and alleles discovered by samtools. The VariantRecalibrator within GATK was used to first model the variants, then GATK ApplyRecalibration was applied to assign VQSLOD scores (see http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/Variant_quality_score_recalibration for more details).
VQSLOD score threshold was set at -0.6804 which improved site concordance with duplicate samples sequenced using high-depth exome sequence methods. Two further thresholds were applied: failure of HWE (P&lt;1e-6) and evidence of batch effects between samples genotyped at Sanger and BGI (P&lt;1e-2). In total, 4.2M variants were removed through these QC criteria. The final set contained over 42M SNVs.
In order to assess the validity of the sequence data, 61 samples were also sequenced using high-depth next generation exome sequencing (depth = 70x), described previously. 74,621 sites were shared out of the 86,322 sites that were called in the exome data, representing a sensitivity of 86.4% across the 35Mb bait region. We assessed the non-reference discordance rate and found that 0.2% were discordant, suggesting that the resultant dataset had high concordance with high depth exome sequencing.

 'Post-genotyping sample QC': |
Of the 4,030 samples (1,990 TwinsUK and 2,040 ALSPAC) that were submitted for sequencing, 3,910 samples (1,934 TwinsUK and 1,976 ALSPAC) were sequenced and went through the variant calling procedure. Low quality samples were identified before the genotype refinement by comparing the samples to their GWAS genotypes using about 20,000 sites on chromosome 20. Comparing the raw genotype calls to these existing GWAS genotypes data, we removed a total of 112 samples (64 TwinsUK and 48 ALSPAC) because of one or more of the following causes: (i) high overall discordance to GWAS genotype data (&gt;3%) (55 TwinsUK and 36 ALSPAC), (ii) heterozygosity rate &gt; 3SD from population mean (1 TwinsUK and 1 ALSPAC), suggesting possible contamination (iii) no GWAS genotype data available for that sample (7 TwinsUK and 0 ALSPAC) and (iv) sample below 4x mean read-depth (1 TwinsUK and 11 ALSPAC). Overall, 3,798 samples (1,870 TwinsUK and 1,928 ALSPAC) were brought forward to the genotype refinement step.

 'Genotype refinement': |
The missing and low confidence genotypes in the filtered VCFs were refined through an imputation procedure with BEAGLE 4. The program was run with default parameters. VCFs were split into chunks each containing a maximum of 3,000 sites plus 1,000 sites in buffer regions, that is 500 on either side. Multiallelic sites were included in the imputation. It took 882 CPU weeks to complete. After imputation, chunks were recombined using the vcf-phased-join script from the vcftools package.

 'Post-refinement sample QC': |
Additional sample-level QC steps were carried out on refined genotypes, leading to the exclusion of additional 17 samples (16 TwinsUK and 1 ALSPAC) due to one or more of the following causes: (i) post- refinement non-reference discordance (NRD) with GWAS data &gt; 5% (12 TwinsUK and 1 ALSPAC), (ii) multiple relations to other samples, i.e. more than 25 relations with IBS&gt;0.125 were deemed indicative of contamination (13 TwinsUK and 1 ALSPAC), (iii) discordance with manifest gender (3 TwinsUK and 0 ALSPAC). To identify these samples we pruned the WGS data to a set of independent SNVs and calculated genome-wide average identity by state between each pair of samples across the two cohorts. The resulting set of contaminated samples corresponded almost completely to the set of samples with NRD&gt;5%. This left a final set of 3,781 samples (1,854 TwinsUK and 1,927 ALSPAC).

  'Removal of related and non-European ancestry samples for association analyses': |
The final release set that passed all QC contains non-European and related samples, both of which we sought to exclude to simplify the association testing. To identify participants of non-European ancestry we merged a pruned dataset to the 11 HapMap3 populations and performed a principal components analysis (PCA) using EIGENSTRAT. A total of 44 participants (12 TwinsUK and 32 ALSPAC) did not cluster to the European (CEU) cluster of samples and were removed from association analyses. Individuals with &gt; 20,000 singleton variants represent ethnic outliers that were excluded from association analyses. We further sought to flag related individuals for exclusion in association tests. Overall, 69 samples (36 TwinsUK and 33 ALSPAC) were flagged because of relatedness greater than third degree (IBS&gt;0.125). Finally 63 co-twin samples (42 dizygotic and 21 monozygotic) and three duplicate samples were removed from TwinsUK. The final sequence data set that was used for the association analyses comprises 3,621 samples (1,754 TwinsUK and 1,867 ALSPAC).

3,453 ALSPAC mother and fathers and 535,478 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip genotyping platforms by the ALSPAC lab and called using GenomeStudio. The resulting raw genome-wide data were subjected to standard quality control methods using PLINK (v1.07). Individuals were excluded on the basis of gender mismatches (n = 80); minimal or excessive heterozygosity (n = 64); disproportionate levels of individual missingness (&gt;5%, n = 60) and possible contamination (n = 3). Population stratification was assessed by multidimensional scaling analysis and compared with 1000 Genomes phase 3 data and principal component analysis (n = 266); all individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as SNP relatedness in GCTA (relatedness &gt; 0.1, n = 69 removed). SNPs with a call rate of &lt; 95% or evidence for violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 1E-7) and those which failed GenomeStudio quality control measures were removed (n = 21,298). 6,594 duplicate SNPs were also removed. 
This resulted in 2,911 unrelated mothers and father genotypes at 507,586 SNPs. We then identified 2217 samples where aln assigned historically by the lab matched genetically assigned aln.  

We phased data of 3074 samples that passed qc but contained related subjects in shapeit v2.r837. We then removed 155,336 monomorphic SNPs, 1033 markers not in 1000 genomes, 11,842 A/T or G/C SNPs and 10 duplicate sites to give 337,732 SNPs on chromosomes 1-23. Of the 329,363 markers on chromosomes 1-22, 298,742 overlapped the reference genome. We imputed to the 1000 genomes phase 1 version 3 using the Michigan Imputation Server. We then identified 2217 samples where aln assigned historically by the lab matched genetically assigned aln. We then removed 12 subjects who have withdrawn consent and 6 subjects genotyped in an earlier work package to give 2201 subjects.

Title: 	Genome-wide array data imputed to the 1000 genomes reference panel for G0 mothers and G1 individuals (phase 1, version 3, release Dec 2013)

Description: |
  SNP chips are useful for the generation of data on hundreds of thousands of SNPs, but there are millions more polymorphisms that remain untyped with this technology. If suitable numbers of whole genome sequences exist (e.g. 1000 genomes data) then millions of genotypes that are missing from a sample because they have not been typed by SNP chips can be imputed using probabilistic methods. Here the ALSPAC mother and children data were imputed to 1000 genomes using the best available phasing and imputation software and reference panels at the time.

  The ALSPAC genotype data generated using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad (children) and Illumina human660W quad (mothers) has been jointly imputed to the 1000 genomes reference panel (Version 1, Phase 3, Dec 2013 Release).

  ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad chip genotyping platforms by 23andme subcontracting the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK and the Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, US. The resulting raw genome-wide data were subjected to standard quality control methods. Individuals were excluded on the basis of gender mismatches; minimal or excessive heterozygosity; disproportionate levels of individual missingness (&gt;3%) and insufficient sample replication (IBD &lt; 0.8). Population stratification was assessed by multidimensional scaling analysis and compared with Hapmap II (release 22) European descent (CEU), Han Chinese, Japanese and Yoruba reference populations; all individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. SNPs with a minor allele frequency of &lt; 1%, a call rate of &lt; 95% or evidence for violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 5E-7) were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as proportion of identity by descent (IBD &gt; 0.1). Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,115 subjects and 500,527 SNPs passed these quality control filters.

  ALSPAC mothers were genotyped using the Illumina human660W-quad array at Centre National de Génotypage (CNG) and genotypes were called with Illumina GenomeStudio. PLINK (v1.07) was used to carry out quality control measures on an initial set of 10,015 subjects and 557,124 directly genotyped SNPs. SNPs were removed if they displayed more than 5% missingness or a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P value of less than 1.0e-06. Additionally SNPs with a minor allele frequency of less than 1% were removed. Samples were excluded if they displayed more than 5% missingness, had indeterminate X chromosome heterozygosity or extreme autosomal heterozygosity. Samples showing evidence of population stratification were identified by multidimensional scaling of genome-wide identity by state pairwise distances using the four HapMap populations as a reference, and then excluded. Cryptic relatedness was assessed using a IBD estimate of more than 0.125 which is expected to correspond to roughly 12.5% alleles shared IBD or a relatedness at the first cousin level. Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,048 subjects and 526,688 SNPs passed these quality control filters.

  We combined 477,482 SNP genotypes in common between the sample of mothers and sample of children. We removed SNPs with genotype missingness above 1% due to poor quality (11,396 SNPs removed) and removed a further 321 subjects due to potential ID mismatches. This resulted in a dataset of 17,842 subjects containing 6,305 duos and 465,740 SNPs (112 were removed during liftover and 234 were out of HWE after combination). We estimated haplotypes using ShapeIT (v2.r644) which utilises relatedness during phasing. We obtained a phased version of the 1000 genomes reference panel (Phase 1, Version 3) from the Impute2 reference data repository (phased using ShapeIt v2.r644, haplotype release date Dec 2013). Imputation of the target data was performed using Impute V2.2.2 against the reference panel (all polymorphic SNPs excluding singletons), using all 2186 reference haplotypes (including non-Europeans).

  This gave 8,237 eligible children and 8,196 eligible mothers with available genotype data after exclusion of related subjects using cryptic relatedness measures described previously.

  ALSPAC mothers were genotyped using the Illumina human660W-quad array at Centre National de Génotypage (CNG) and genotypes were called with Illumina GenomeStudio. PLINK (v1.07) was used to carry out quality control measures on an initial set of 10,015 subjects and 557,124 directly genotyped SNPs. SNPs were removed if they displayed more than 5% missingness or a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P value of less than 1.0e-06. Additionally SNPs with a minor allele frequency of less than 1% were removed. Samples were excluded if they displayed more than 5% missingness, had indeterminate X chromosome heterozygosity or extreme autosomal heterozygosity. Samples showing evidence of population stratification were identified by multidimensional scaling of genome-wide identity by state pairwise distances using the four HapMap populations as a reference, and then excluded. Cryptic relatedness was assessed using a IBD estimate of more than 0.125 which is expected to correspond to roughly 12.5% alleles shared IBD or a relatedness at the first cousin level. Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,048 subjects and 526,688 SNPs passed these quality control filters.


  This gave 8,196 eligible mothers with available genotype data after exclusion of related subjects using cryptic relatedness measures described previously.

Title: ALSPAC imputed to Hapmap

Description: |
  SNP chips are useful for the generation of data on hundreds of thousands of SNPs, but there are millions more polymorphisms that remain untyped with this technology. If suitable numbers of whole genome sequences exist (e.g. Hapmap data) then millions of genotypes that are missing from a sample because they have not been typed by SNP chips can be imputed using probabilistic methods. Here the ALSPAC children data were imputed to Hapmap genomes using the best available phasing and imputation software and reference panels at the time.

  The ALSPAC genotype data generated using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad (children) and has been imputed to the Hapmap genomes reference panel.

 ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad chip genotyping platforms by 23andme subcontracting the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK and the Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, US. The resulting raw genome-wide data were subjected to standard quality control methods. Individuals were excluded on the basis of gender mismatches; minimal or excessive heterozygosity; disproportionate levels of individual missingness (&gt;3%) and insufficient sample replication (IBD &lt; 0.8). Population stratification was assessed by multidimensional scaling analysis and compared with Hapmap II (release 22) European descent (CEU), Han Chinese, Japanese and Yoruba reference populations; all individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. SNPs with a minor allele frequency of &lt; 1%, a call rate of &lt; 95% or evidence for violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 5E-7) were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as proportion of identity by descent (IBD &gt; 0.1). Related subjects that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,115 subjects and 500,527 SNPs passed these quality control filters.

3,453 ALSPAC mother and fathers and 535,478 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip genotyping platforms by the ALSPAC lab and called using GenomeStudio. The resulting raw genome-wide data were subjected to standard quality control methods using PLINK (v1.07). Individuals were excluded on the basis of gender mismatches (n = 80); minimal or excessive heterozygosity (n = 64); disproportionate levels of individual missingness (&gt;5%, n = 60) and possible contamination (n = 3). Population stratification was assessed by multidimensional scaling analysis and compared with 1000 Genomes phase 3 data and principal component analysis (n = 266); all individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as SNP relatedness in GCTA (relatedness &gt; 0.1, n = 69 removed). SNPs with a call rate of &lt; 95% or evidence for violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &lt; 1E-7) and those which failed GenomeStudio quality control measures were removed (n = 21,298). 6,594 duplicate SNPs were also removed. 
This resulted in 2,911 unrelated mothers and father genotypes at 507,586 SNPs. We then identified 2217 samples where aln assigned historically by the lab matched genetically assigned aln.  

We identified 2217 samples where aln assigned historically by the lab matched genetically assigned aln. We then removed 12 subjects who have withdrawn consent and 6 subjects genotyped in an earlier work package to give 2201 subjects.

  NB date written is appropximate here (AG).  

  23andMe identifiers were in the form "ALSPAC&lt;n&gt;" where &lt;n&gt; is a numeric identifier.  I had to use the "23andMe.recode" file to convert these identifiers back to ALN:QLET.  However, there are some "duplicate" ALNs in this file, e.g. see ALSPAC09899933 (ALN 38877) and ALSPAC09900002 (ALN 38877D).  Therefore, I used ALSPAC_10K_UNRELATEDS_FINAL.fam (the magic 8365 dataset) to fetch a list of identifiers that I should be using, i.e. should I use the 38877 or 38877D ALN.

  For the final version of the dataset, I removed any remaining "D" characters from the ALN:QLET (as per conversations with Chris Raistrick).

  Also, there were some "missing" individuals from the 23andMe raw data, see run.out. 

## Identifiers

**Raised by**: Anna Guyatt
**Date written**: 2016-09-08
**Date resolved**: not yet resolved
**Resolved by**: N/A

  AG found one individual with 'D' ALN in original dataset. This has been removed during the QC process and this subject is not present in the filtered.cnv file in the 'derived' folder.

  This release contains predicted ALSPAC CNVs using PennCNV.

  LRR and BAF data was missing from the 23andMe raw genotype data, so we had to generate this data ourselves using an in house algorithm that Tom wrote (see make.sh in code release).

  Once this data has been generated, I ran PennCNV using the hh550 libraries (see PennCNV.sh in code release).

  There are two different version of QC available, one performed by David Evans for the Bryois et al 2014 paper, and one performed by Gibran Hemani for the molgenis eQTL mapping meta analysis. 

Summary:
  Platform: Illumina Human HT-12 V3 BeadChips
  Number of individuals: 931
  Number of probes: 48804
Bryois: |
  LCL's from unrelated individuals were grown under identical conditions and cells frozen in RNAlater. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and was amplified using the Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification kit (Ambion). Expression profiling of the samples, each with two technical replicates, were performed using the Illumina Human HT-12 V3 BeadChips (Illumina Inc) including 48,804 probes where 200 ng of total RNA was processed according to the protocol supplied by Illumina. Raw data was imported to the Illumina Beadstudio software and probes with less than three beads present were excluded. Log2 - transformed expression signals were then normalized with quantile normalization of the replicates of each individual followed by quantile normalization across all individuals. We restricted our analysis to 23'935 probes tagging genes annotated in Ensembl. Principal component analysis was performed on 931 individuals. 62 individuals with principal component 1 or 2 greater than one standard deviation of the population were excluded from further analysis. See http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004461 for full details.
Molgenis: |
  Genetic outliers were removed, any individuals that were clear outliers in the first 2 genetic principal components. Each probe was simply quantile normalised and then log2 transformed. Then adjusted for the first 4 genetic MDS, expression principal components (excluding those that had genetic associations), and scaled to have mean 0 and variance 1. See https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/eQTL-mapping-analysis-cookbook for full details.

  `data.Robj`: manifest file with columns extracted directly from LIMS and age, sex, aln, timepoint, timecode, sampletype, genotypeQC columns to remove population stratification samples, duplicate.rm column to remove duplicates. Samples in rows, variables in columns.

"`betas`": | 
  `data.Robj`: normalized betas using functional normalization. We used 10 PCs on the controlmatrix to regress out technical variation. Slide was regressed out as random effect before normaliziation. Data is stored as a RData object. CpGs are in rows and samples in columns.

"`control_matrix`": |
  `data.txt`: The 850 control probes are summarized in 42 control types. These probes can roughly be divided into negative control probes (613), probes intended for between array normalization (186) and the remainder (49), which are designed for quality control, including assessing the bisulfite conversion rate. None of these probes are designed to measure a biological signal.  The summarized control probes can be used as surrogates for unwanted variation and are used for the functional normalization. In this text file, sampels are rows and 42 control types are in columns.

"`detection_p_values`": |
  `data.Robj`:  This matrix shows the detection pvalues for each sample and each CpG and is extracted from the idat files using the "meffil.load.detection.pvalues" function in meffil. Data is stored as a RData object. CpGs are in rows and samples in columns.

"`qc.objects_clean`": |
  `data.Robj`: All data processing has been conducted using Meffil. Meffil uses illuminaio R package to parse Illumina IDAT files into a meffil object called norm.objects. All meffil functions, QC summary, functional normalization and post-normalization QC summary operate on the norm.objects. Specifically, the norm.objects contain raw control probe intensities, quantile distributions of the raw intensities, poor quality probes based on detection Pvalues and number of beads, predicted sex,  predicted cellcounts and a samplesheet with batch variables. In addition, copy number variation can be extracted. This object is a list of individuals.

"`qc.objects_all`": |
  `data.Robj`: This objects contain all 5469 samples extracted from LIMS and is not cleaned up. This object has been used to do the data cleaning. All data processing has been conducted using Meffil. Meffil uses illuminaio R package to parse Illumina IDAT files into a meffil object called qc.objects. All meffil functions, QC summary, functional normalization and post-normalization QC summary operate on the qc or norm.objects. Specifically, the qc.objects contain raw control probe intensities, poor quality probes based on detection Pvalues and number of beads, predicted sex,  predicted cellcounts and a samplesheet with batch variables. In addition, copy number variation can be extracted. This object is a list of individuals.

"`derived/cellcounts/houseman/data.txt`": |
  Cell counts extracted using Houseman algorithm implemented in meffil (PMID: 22568884). In this text file, samples are in rows and cell types in columns.

"`derived/cellcounts/cord/gervinandlyle`": |
  Cellcounts in cord predicted using GervinandLyle cord reference (unpublised). This reference has been implemented in meffil. In this text file, samples are in rows and cell types in columns.

"`derived/cellcounts/cord/gse68456`": |
  Cellcounts in cord predicted using cord reference published in de Goede et al (PMID: 26366232). This reference has been implemented in meffil. In this text file, samples are in rows and cell types in columns.

"`derived/cellcounts/cord/andrews-and-bakulski`": |
  Cellcounts in cord predicted using cord reference published in Bakulski et al 2016 (PMID: 27019159). This reference has been implemented in meffil. In this text file, samples are in rows and cell types in columns.

"`derived/reports/qc`": |
  Using meffil on `qc.objects_all` we have generated a qc.report: `ARIESall_qc-report.html`. Based on the plots here we have cleaned the data. 

"`derived/reports/normalization`": |
  Includes `normalization-report.pc*160915.html`. Using meffil on `betas` and normalisation objects generates these reports. It shows PCA plots on control probes and normalized betas. In addition it shows associations between PCs and batch variables.

Sample description: |
  In total there are 5469 samples for five timepoints (cord=1127; F7=1086; 15up=1073; antenatal=1100; FOM=1083) measured belonging to the 1022 mother-child pairs. The 15up samples are a mixture of 277 samples of kids at TF3 clinic at 15 yrs and 796 TF4 clinic at age 17 yrs. FOM consists of FOM (mothers at FOM clinic) and TF1-3 (mothers at child clinics TF1 to 3). There are 369 technical replicates (361 duplicates + 8 triplicates). Most of these samples are poor quality samples (low detection score) and were therefore repeated in the lab. 4904/5469 ARIES samples have been successfully genotyped. 112/5469 samples failed genotype QC due to sample swaps, gender mismatches, high IBD or relatedness issues between mums and kids and were removed from ARIES. We found 411 genotype mismatches (with a concordance below 80%) between the 65 snp probes on the 450k array and the genotype arrays with a concordance below 80% and these samples are removed. Furthermore, samples were removed if: i) mum samples had more than 90% concordance with a kids sample (22 samples) ii) concordance was below 80% between duplicates and less than 80% concordance with at least one other mums of kids sample (N=200). iii) mums samples of which concordance was below 80% between duplicates (N=10) iv) samples with low concordance (below 80%) with other timepoints (N=10). v) mums samples with low concordance (below 80%) with other timepoints (N=24). Methylation quality was checked by: sexcheck (N=191), the median intensity methylated vs unmethylated signal for all control probes (N=63), dyebias (N=14), detection pvalue (N=166), low bead numbers (N=2) and post normalization checks (N=13). The data was normalized using functional normalization (Fortin et al.). As we found that slide effects were large even after normalization, we regressed out slide on the raw betas before normalization and on the controlmatrix. After normalization 13 additional samples were removed during PCA analysis. After cleanup, we have 4854 samples including 71 replicates (9-25 samples for each timepoint) and 191 samples which are population stratification outliers in the genotype data. The userguide shows how to remove these samples.
